# 👕 Virtual Dressing Room - Size Prediction Model

This project implements a Machine Learning (ML) solution for recommending the optimal clothing size to users based on their body measurements. It employs classification algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree** to predict a user's size (e.g., S, M, L, XL), aiming to improve online shopping accuracy and reduce returns.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed. The following libraries are required:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib` (for visualization)
* `joblib` (for saving models)

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
